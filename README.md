# Dummy Tab

Let you create any dummy tabs with a custom title and empty content.

## Hmmm... Any use for this?

As a person who always has tons of (Chrome) tabs plus windows (as different workspaces), I often find locating my workspaces very hard. But with this, I can create a dummy tab with custom title as an anchor, put it at the top of all tabs and hide it behind a custom tab group.

Hiding behind a tab group basically let you "name" any Chrome windows as you want. And combining this with extension like [Quick Tabs] or Chrome's own "Search Tab" feature (⇧⌘A or `Ctrl + Shift + A` if you are Windows user), you can quickly, easily switch between "named" workspaces using the anchor. Here's an example:

Well, in other words, this extension is a game changer for me, but perhaps not for you.

## TODO

-   Typeahead suggestion - show titles previously entered
-   Auto-generate website icon based on the first character
-   Improve this crappy look
